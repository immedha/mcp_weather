# CSE 473 R2 Homework
This is code for a basic Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server and client.

Currently the server has 2 tools: getting the weather alerts and weather forecast. It uses the NWS (National Weather Service) API for this.


Install the dependencies through `uv`, they are all listed in `pyproject.toml`. 

Run the server by doing `uv run server.py`.

Run this code by doing `python client.py server.py`.
