# CSE 473 R2 Homework
This is code for a basic Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server and client.

Currently the server has 2 tools: getting the weather alerts and weather forecast. It uses the NWS (National Weather Service) API for this.

Run this code by doing `python client.py ../weather/weather.py`
